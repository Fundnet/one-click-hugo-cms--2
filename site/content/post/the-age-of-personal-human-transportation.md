A number of recent events have convinced me that we are at the dawn of a new age in personal human transportation. New devices and services are coming to market so quickly that it’s likely that within 10 years, automation of transportation will actually start to change us as a species.

When you think about it, for as long as we humans have been around, we have sought to ease our burden of transporting ourselves and our belongings. From Roman chariots to U-hauls, bikes to Ubers, we want to propel ourselves as cheaply, comfortably and affordably as possible. This is both an innate desire and an inalienable right.

Today we’re witnessing unparalleled manufacturing capability.  The combination of high-quality on-demand manufacturing (largely from China) along with open source, freemium and/or extremely cost-effective platforms enable us to design, manufacture, market and distribute new products unlike any time in human history. It is starting to have radical effects on what we can buy.  And this mix is indeed changing the very fundamentals of what we can physically do.  Along the way, we will see it eventually change the notion our very being.

It’s this combination of never before seen intelligence and capabilities that is so fundamentally different. Truly enabling the manufacture of a new wave of cost-effective devices so radical we would have only thought of them as kids when looking at comic books. But they’re coming, And coming fast.

So what caused this epiphany?

It first started with two kids on the street. Waiting at the light, I watched two kids, (one in grade 6 and one grade 8) wheel back-and-forth on a couple of devices called Hoverboards. They displayed such effortless motion that you would almost think they were born with them.

The Lamborghini model, which one can apparently buy online for about $500, goes over curbs, will run about 40 km at a top speed of 25 km.  Think of an electric snowboard with two with self-balancing wheels and you’ll get the idea.  Anyone with any reasonable sense of balance and strength in their legs can apparently operate one.

As I was talking to them, not one but two people showed up in electric wheelchairs. No, neither were about to be about to ride a hoverboard. But what if you are in your 50’s with a sore knee and are not enamored by the wheelchair option?

The second was an actual jet powered hoverboard.  If you think of the Goblin in Spiderman you’ll get the idea.  The board has so much power it can apparently take someone up to 10,000 feet in the air.  It made a lot of noise, but so did the first generation of two stroke jet skis which are now as quiet as motorbikes.

What could possibly beat that?  How about a fully automated personal drone helicopter.  A Chinese company recently signed a deal with a major US health company to ship human organs, likely between regional health centers.
